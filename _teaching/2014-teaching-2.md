Project-based class in which students develop an "at home lab activity" to teach parents about some aspect of cognitive development. Examples include measuring the child's N-knower level or plotting a habituation curve. Students will be responsible for reading several papers about a scientific finding in cognitive development, piloting a parent-friendly version with local families, and preparing a written and video guide to trying it at home.
