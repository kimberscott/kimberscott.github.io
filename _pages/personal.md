Some hobbies besides keeping children alive:

- [salsa dancing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVUZN3J0C0I)

- [the game of Set](http://www.mit.edu/~kimscott/setgame.html)

- [partner acrobatics](http://www.eshcircusarts.com/)

I kept track of a lot of things my oldest son said as he learned to talk [here](https://remysays.tumblr.com/tagged/chrono/chrono). Sometimes they're relevant to cognitive development (feel free to use--just let us know, because he'll be proud).
