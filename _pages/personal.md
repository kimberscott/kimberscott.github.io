I have at various times enjoyed [salsa dancing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVUZN3J0C0I), long solo bike trips, and [the game of Set](http://www.mit.edu/~kimscott/setgame.html). Right now mostly I enjoy sleep and keeping children alive... also partner acrobatics.

I kept track of a lot of things my oldest son said as he learned to talk [here](http://remysays.tumblr.com/page/50). Sometimes they're relevant to cognitive development (feel free to use, but let us know because he'll be proud).
