Some hobbies outside of studying & raising children:

- [salsa dancing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVUZN3J0C0I)

- [the game of Set](http://www.mit.edu/~kimscott/setgame.html)

- [partner acrobatics](http://www.eshcircusarts.com/)

Personal projects:

- I kept track of a lot of things my oldest son said as he learned to talk [here](https://remysays.tumblr.com/tagged/chrono/chrono). Sometimes they're relevant to cognitive development (feel free to use--just let us know, because he'll be proud).

- To familiarize myself with Django I'm building a [simple implementation](https://github.com/kimberscott/minichore) of my family's 
system for assigning chores to household members... which is to say, brute-force minimax.
How cool is it to know that, by your very own rankings, you are doing 45% of the work, and 
so is your partner?

- Frequently adjusting insulin dosing protocols in insulin-dependent diabetes is critically important, but it's a time-consuming challenge for patients and clinicians that tends to involve... staring at a chart and thinking hard. I'm trying out a simple approach 
[using a Bayes net](https://github.com/kimberscott/bayesian-intensive-insulin) to directly implement the causal model that humans are implicitly trying to use for inference.
