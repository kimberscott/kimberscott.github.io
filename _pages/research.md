## Lookit: bringing developmental studies home

The Lookit website allows families to participate in                                     developmental studies online using their own computer and webcam.                                    Why put experiments online? We're looking to get more representative samples,                                     reduce the cost of participation for both families and researchers, improve retention in longitudinal studies, observe more natural behavior, and access special populations. And of course, online studies are a great opportunity for science outreach as well as increasing the replicability of our work.

Learn more or participate at [Lookit](https://lookit.mit.edu), view the source code on [github](https://github.com/lookit/) (lookit, experimenter, and                                      exp-addons repos), or connect with us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/lookit.mit.edu).

Some of my other graduate work has focused on early conscious experience: for instance, how infants merge multiple representations of the same concept; understand the passage of time; and distinguish among imagery, memory, and  perception.
