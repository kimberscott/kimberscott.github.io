## Lookit: bringing developmental studies home

<img src="../../files/img/computerbaby.jpg" alt="toddler on the computer" class="research_thumbnail" />

The Lookit website allows families to participate in developmental studies online using their own computer and webcam. Why put experiments online? We're looking to:

- work with "real" (more representative) families - not just the folks who live near developmental labs and can come in on weekdays

- enable more people to do rigorous developmental research - especially people with ideas that directly benefit kids and families, like early childhood educators

- allow researchers to collect larger sample sizes when needed - for instance, to measure graded effects instead of just comparing A and B, or to make studies more robust and reproducible

- improve retention in longitudinal studies, and make it possible to try out the sorts of intensive interventions that might really make a difference

- observe more natural behavior in the home, rather than the "going on a special trip" behavior we see in the lab

- accelerate work with special populations (for example, kids with rare developmental disorders, scattered across the world)

- make it easier to share complete protocols and materials so that other scientists can understand and build on a finding

Learn more or participate with your kids at [Lookit](https://lookit.mit.edu), view the source code on [github](https://github.com/lookit/) (lookit, experimenter, and                                      exp-addons repos), or connect with us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/lookit.mit.edu) or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/babiesoflookit/).

## What's it like to be a baby?

My more empirical work has focused on early conscious experience: for instance, how infants merge multiple representations of the same concept; understand the passage of time; and distinguish among imagery, memory, and  perception.
