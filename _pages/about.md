I'm currently a research scientist in the [Early Childhood Cognition Lab](http://eccl.mit.edu/) at [MIT](http://www.mit.edu/). I developed and currently run an online platform for doing behavioral research with children, [Lookit](https://lookit.mit.edu/). Among other applications, I'm especially interested in using this platform to refine developmental methods and to better characterize individual differences in development.
