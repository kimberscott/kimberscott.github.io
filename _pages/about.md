I'm currently a software engineer at [Form Energy](https://formenergy.com/), which is working towards a 100% renewable electric
grid by developing long-duration energy storage. I develop tools for researchers to access
and analyze data from experiments on batteries.

Until 2021, I was a research scientist in the 
[Early Childhood Cognition Lab](http://eccl.mit.edu/) at [MIT](http://www.mit.edu/). I 
developed and ran the online platform for doing behavioral research with children  
[Lookit](https://lookit.mit.edu/).
